User Registration & Login Website
  This project demonstrates how to create a basic Registration and Login workflow using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 ##Overview
  The goal of this project is to provide a minimal working example of a website that allows new users to register and returning users to log in. It covers:
    1.Building responsive form layouts in HTML
    2.Styling forms and elements with CSS (including Flexbox and basic media queries)
    3.Implementing front-end JavaScript validation (e.g., checking required fields, password match)
    4.Adding icons (e.g., eye‐icon for show/hide password, user and lock icons) via Ionicons
---Explaining the basic flow:
 *A visitor opens the Registration page → fills in name, email, password, confirms password → JS validates → shows success or errors
 *A visitor opens the Login page → enters email and password → JS validates → (in a real app) submits to a backend endpoint

##Technologies
1.HTML5 – semantic markup for forms and structure
2.CSS3 – styling with Flexbox, responsive design, and custom variables
3.JavaScript (ES6+) – DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation
4.Ionicons – open‐source icon library (we use CDN links to pull in icons like person-outline, mail-outline, lock-closed-outline, eye-outline, etc.)
--You can replace Ionicons with any other icon set if desired, but this example assumes Ionicons is included via a <link> (CDN) in the <head> of each HTML file.
